# Sudoku
- A cool little application I made that has multi-functionality along the lines of Sudokus

# Running the Code
- I will test it for working outside of the VS environment, for now place both files into a folder and run it in Visual Studio. 
- The startingsudoku needs to be included with the .cpp file

# UI 
- To Start either run the Generate or Import commands. 
- The Import command has 2 options
  - Creating a new sudoku: Let's you enter your own sudoku for solving 
  - Import from a File: Lets you input a sudoku going line by line (See startingsudoku.txt for an example)
- Check Sudoku makes sure that your Sudoku is still solveable, it will most likely be used for those that Enter/Input their own sudokus
- Solve it Yourself: Let's the user solve the sudoku themselves
- Computer Solve: Uses my homebrew algorithm to solve a sudoku of any difficulty
- Save your Sudoku: Let's you save your unifinished sudokus for later

# Goals
- Seperate the Code into Header files and order classes better
  - I Wrote this before I understood good organization and readability of code
